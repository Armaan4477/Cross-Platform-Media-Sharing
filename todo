In Progress:

Nishal:
After sending and receiving is complete
Loop back around karo as in sender ko option do if he wants to send more files/folders
If yes wapas back to select file window
If no then back to main window
(FYI Receiver ka logic bhe modify karna padega sath mai Varna pura fail hoga)

Urmi:
Find a logo/Icon for our Project and send it on the group (image should be in png, without a background and high quality.)
(upload the full quality images in the shared drive, make a new folder there and then tell us on the group so we will check it out)



Next Task:

Nishal:
1) Drag and drop file support in send section of the python app

2) Add credits dialog which links to project repo link and github/ Linkedin accounts (Armaan, Samay, Yash, Nishal and Urmi ka naam in Alphabetical order(Vedashree ka naam jayega jab vo kaam karegi kuch coding related to the actual project))

3) When the receiver window shows file received successfully, show the user a button which will take them to the receiving directory.    (ps. you can easily get the receiving directry from the get_config that is imported)


Urmi:
1) If during file/folder receiving there is a file/folder already present with the same name add (1),(2) and so on for the copies that are present. 

2) When sending a folder show the number of total files, number of files completed and number of files remaining.
(ps. Total files metadata.json mai already ja raha hai incase needed hai)
