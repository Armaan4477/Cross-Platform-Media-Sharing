## How It Works

1. **Discover Devices**: The sender discovers available receivers on the network.
2. **Establish Connection**: A connection is created using JSON exchange, sharing metadata like IP address and OS type.
3. **Select Files**: The sender chooses files or folders to transfer. If encryption is enabled, a password is required.
4. **Transfer Process**: 
   - Metadata is sent first to the receiver.
   - Files are transferred using a Depth-First Search (DFS)-based logic over TCP.
   - The receiver processes incoming data using flags and tags to ensure proper structure and completeness.
