Pending priority work:
1) Send more files button and go to main menu button in python and Android after first transfer is complete.(ports handling needs to be improved to correctly be reused and closed)
2) Device discovery using bluetooth- Python/Android/IOS
3) IpadOS/IOS app

Overall FUTURE IDEAS:
1) Qr-Code Based device connection
2) File transfer over bluetooth- Python/Android (bluetooth doesnt work well with apple devices)
3) File transfer over wifi direct- Python/Android/IOS
4) IpadOS/IOS app
5) Can give priority to some file from new optional window if its needed urgently when many files are shared at once- Python/Android/IOS
6) Optional Encryption- IOS (after app is built and running)
7) Add confirmation dialog which ask the user if they are sure to receive the file or not, give prompt to sender that file sharing was cancelled- Python/Android/IOS
8) When file is sent give button to ask if they want to send one more file- Python/Android/IOS
9) Add button to go back to main send receive Window- Python/Android/IOS
10) Drag and drop support in send section of the app- Python/Android/IOS
11) Limit sharing speed for file to reduce network congrestion- Python/Android/IOS
12) Background run and transfer mode- Python/Android/IOS
13) Notifications for the app, implement after background run mode- Python/Android/IOS
14) Send notes along with files- Python/Android/IOS
15) Pause and resume for file transfer feature- Python/Android/IOS
16) Auto Pause incase of network loss, resume when connection is reestablished- Python/Android/IOS
17) Fixed Password for send/receive logic to confirm identity and work with unattended- Python/Android/IOS
18) Introduce basic theming or customization options (dark mode/light mode).
19) Ability to pause/resume/reorder queued transfers
20) File integrity verification after transfer
21) File Transfer history
22) File preview before sending/after receiving
23) Hot-Key Support (customizable by the user)
24) Multiple Device Simultaneous Sending
25) Optional Compression system
26) Adaptive Chunks based on network health


Crazy Future idea: 
1) Web app
2) Android TV app:
    The movies we send will remain in the app data with an option to open the file in VLC player and with the built-in file manager, you will be able to delete movies and other files
