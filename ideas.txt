Pending priority work:
2) Send more files button and go to main menu button in python and Android.
5) Redo windows built app to avoid Defender blocking the whole app.
7) Implement new config json overwrite feature like it is in python.



Overall FUTURE IDEAS:
2) Device discovery using bluetooth- Python/Android/IOS
3) File transfer over bluetooth- Python/Android (bluetooth doesnt work well with non apple devices)
4) File transfer over wifi direct- Python/Android/IOS
5) IpadOS/IOS app
6) Can give priority to some file from new optional window if its needed urgently when many files are shared at once- Python/Android/IOS
7) When file is selected to be sent show the size of the file that has been selected in the window- Python/Android/IOS
8) Optional Encryption- IOS
9) Add confirmation dialog which ask the user if they are sure to receive the file or not, give prompt to sender that file sharing was cancelled- Python/Android/IOS
10) When file is sent give button to ask if they want to send one more file- Python/Android/IOS
11) Add button to go back to main send receive Window- Python/Android/IOS
12) Add direct repo link for open source contribution- Python/Android/IOS
13) Drag and drop support in send section of the app- Python/Android/IOS
14) Limit sharing speed for file to reduce network congrestion- Python/Android/IOS
15) File preview mode which only downloads and views the file without storing it (files smaller than 100mb)- Python/Android/IOS
16) Background run and transfer mode- Python/Android/IOS
17) Notifications for the app, implement after background run mode- Python/Android/IOS
18) Send notes along with files- Python/Android/IOS
19) Advaned telemetry which shows copy speed approx time remaining and total time- Android/IOS
20) Pause and resume feature- Python/Android/IOS
21) Auto Pause incase of network loss, resume when connection is reestablished- Python/Android/IOS
22) When sending a folder show the number of total files, number of files completed and number of files remaining.
23) Add tip a coffee button which links to upi Id- Python/Android/IOS



Crazy Future idea: 
1) Web app
2) Android TV app:
    The movies we send will remain in the app data with an option to open the file in VLC player and with the built-in file manager, you will be able to delete movies and other files
